      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Adenike Oloyede is a Nigerian, who is currently studying Computer & Information Systems in Cyber Security at Douglas College, 
        New Westminster BC, Canada in North America. I previously worked as an IT support staff in Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company
         Ltd before I decided to pursue my career in Cyber-Security.</p>
      <p>I studied computer science as a background in my first degree and I wish to improve my knowledge of cyber security to support 
        and protect many organizations and countries from Hackers.</p>
      <p>I chose to study for the Computer & Information Systems Cybersecurity program at Douglass College Canada to acquire the
         fundamental tools needed for new technical knowledge that will enable me to take up the responsibilities of managing any type of
          threat to an organizations and countries at large</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>I'd like to Learn more about HTML, JavaScript and other related information on how to design websites
        as Understanding coding languages as a cybersecurity professional is essential so 
        you can “speak” the language of those you are trying to defend an organization from:</p>
        <P> Also,Understanding how different programming languages are used in cybersecurity will help you ascertain
           an attackers methodology and mitigate any potential damage. Plus, you can use them to build tools that can defend an
            organizations systems and networks against cyberattacks</P>
